[build]
# netlify has just, but it's undocumented
# it also has mise? so I can set my build command to use that, I guess
# see: https://answers.netlify.com/t/update-just-version/136800/2
command = "mise use -g just@latest && just build"
# the rest is pretty standard; figure I'd move it here from UI
publish = "dist"

# also, can't set node version here - it uses .node-version
