Over on my main website, the my annual "Favorite Media of the Year" post has been published! You can read it there:

<h3 class="pb-6 text-center">https://xavd.id/blog/post/favorite-media-2024/</h3>

As a result, the pages for the winning media have been updated to reflect their reward (as have the aggregation pages, like [/games/awarded](/games/awarded/)). You can also see a full list of eligible [games](/games/years/2024/), [movies](/movies/years/2024/), and [books](/books/years/2024/) to see if you think I made the right picks.

Any big snubs? Any surprises? [Let me know](/contact/) what you think!
