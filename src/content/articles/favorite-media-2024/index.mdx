Over on my main website, the my annual "Favorite Media of the Year" post has been published! You can read it there:

### https://xavd.id/blog/post/favorite-media-2024/

As a result, the pages for the winning media have been updated to reflect their reward (as have the aggregation pages, like <SubtleLink href="/games/awarded/" >/games/awarded</SubtleLink>). You can also see a full list of eligible <SubtleLink href="/games/years/2024" >games</SubtleLink>, <SubtleLink href="/movies/years/2024" >movies</SubtleLink>, and <SubtleLink href="/books/years/2024" >books</SubtleLink> to see if you think I made the right picks.

Any big snubs? Any surprises? <SubtleLink href="/contact" >Let me know</SubtleLink> what you think!
