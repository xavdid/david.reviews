# Drop Me a Line

I love to hear from readers! Please drop a line via email [hello @ david.reviews](mailto:hello@david.reviews) with any comments, concerns, recommendations, suggestions, or bug reports.

You can also mention me on <MastodonIcon />[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@xavdid) or <BlueskyIcon />[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/david.reviews) if that's more convenient.

## Developers / Publishers

If you'd like me to review your game (whether it's coming soon or already released), please get in touch! Email is best: [games @ david.reviews](mailto:games@david.reviews). I'm also on <DiscordIcon />[Discord](https://discord.com/users/249314141683056640) as `@xavdid`. We likely share some servers already!

> Please note: I don't have the bandwidth to write reviews for demos or early-access releases. The best time to reach out is when your 1.0 is on the near horizon.

In exchange for being provided a review key, I'm happy to publish an honest review of your game. Depending on my bandwidth, it may be a shortish one (like the one I wrote for <SubtleLink href="/games/dragon-quest-xi-echoes-of-an-elusive-age/#2025-09-14">Dragon Quest XI</SubtleLink>) or a longer feature (like my [Roottrees are Dead](/articles/the-roottrees-are-dead-review/) article).

If a shorter review is a dealbreaker, please get in touch before sending a key. If you send an unsolicited key, I reserve the right to choose the review type based on my availability.

Lastly, I do my best to accommodate the requests I get, but I've got a day job. If you need the review published by a certain date, please include that (and any embargo information) in your email and I'll see what I can do!

### Available Platforms

I'm able to review games on the following platforms (listed in roughly decreasing order of preference):

- Steam (using a mid-range PC or an M1 Macbook Pro)
- PS5
- Xbox Series S
- iOS (iPad & iPhone)
- Switch

## Authors

I'm a big reader, but I go through books slowly (which doesn't always play nicely with marking schedules). That said, I'm a pretty forgiving book reviewer, so we'll probably get along. Feel free to drop a line at: [books @ david.reviews](mailto:books@david.reviews).
