# Contact

## Developers / Publishers

If you'd like me to review your game (even if it's already released), please get in touch! Email is best: press@david.reviws.

In exchange for being provided a review key, I'm happy to publish an honest, long-form review of your game (like the one I <SubtleLink href="/articles/beast-breaker-review/">wrote for Beast Breaker</SubtleLink>). Putting that together takes time, so please include information about your release schedule, embargo dates, and deadlines.

I'm able to review on any of the following platforms (listed in rough order of preference):

- Steam (using a mid-range PC or a Macbook Pro)
- PS5
- Xbox Series S
- Switch

## Everyone Else

I love to hear from readers! Please drop a line to hello@david.reviews with any comments, concerns, recommendations, or suggestions.
