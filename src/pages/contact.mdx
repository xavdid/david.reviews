# Drop Me a Line

I love to hear from readers! Please drop a line via email [hello @ david.reviews](mailto:hello@david.reviews) with any comments, concerns, recommendations, suggestions, or bug reports.

Alternatively, you can mention / DM me on <MastodonIcon />[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@xavdid) or <BlueskyIcon />[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/david.reviews).

## Developers / Publishers

If you'd like me to review your game (whether it's coming soon or already released), please get in touch! Email is best: [games @ david.reviews](mailto:games@david.reviews).

> Please note: I don't have the bandwidth to write reviews for demos or early-access releases. The best time to reach out is when your 1.0 is on the near horizon.
>
> Also, I can give you a better sense of my schedule if you reach out via the email above rather than sending a game directly through my Steam Curator.

In exchange for being provided a review key, I'm happy to publish an honest, long-form review of your game (like the one I wrote for [The Roottrees are Dead](/articles/the-roottrees-are-dead-review/)). I'm able to review games on the following platforms (listed in roughly decreasing order of preference):

- Steam (using a mid-range PC or a Macbook Pro)
- PS5
- Xbox Series S
- iOS (iPad & iPhone)
- Switch

Writing takes time and I've got a day job, but I do my best to accommodate the requests I get. If you need the review published by a certain date, please include that (and any embargo information) in your inquiry.

## Authors

I'm a big reader, but I go through books slowly (which doesn't always play nicely with marking schedules). That said, I'm a pretty forgiving book reviewer, so we'll probably get along. Feel free to drop a line at: [books @ david.reviews](mailto:books@david.reviews).
