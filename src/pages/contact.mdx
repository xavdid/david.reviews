# Drop Me a Line

## Developers / Publishers

If you'd like me to review your game (whether it's coming soon or already released), please get in touch! Email is best: <ExternalLink href="mailto:games@david.reviews">games @ david.reviews</ExternalLink>.

In exchange for being provided a review key, I'm happy to publish an honest, long-form review of your game (like the one I <SubtleLink href="/articles/tactical-breach-wizards-review/">wrote for Tactical Breach Wizards</SubtleLink>). I'm able to review on any of the following platforms (listed in rough order of preference):

- Steam (using a mid-range PC or a Macbook Pro)
- PS5
- Xbox Series S
- Switch

Writing takes time and I've got a day job, but I do my best to accommodate the requests I get. If you need the review published by a certain date, please include that (and any embargo information) in your inquiry.

## Authors

I'm a big reader, but I go through books slowly (which doesn't always play nicely with marking schedules). That said, I'm a pretty forgiving book reviewer, so we'll probably get along. Feel free to drop a line at: <ExternalLink href="mailto:books@david.reviews">books @ david.reviews</ExternalLink>.

## Everyone Else

I love to hear from readers! Please drop a line to <ExternalLink href="mailto:hello@david.reviews">hello @ david.reviews</ExternalLink> with any comments, concerns, recommendations, suggestions, or bug reports.
